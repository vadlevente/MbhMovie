Dear [Candidate],

I am happy to let you know that we would like to proceed with your application for
the Android Software Engineer position. The next step in the process is a technical
assessment completing a technical task.

You can download a skeleton project here, please implement your solution starting
from this. I also attached the instructions about the requirements of the task.

You can use any 3rd party libraries you see fit. I understand there are some technologies
you might not be familiar with - Compose, Coroutine Flows, etc; this might be a
good opportunity to learn and experiment with some.

We have a 1 week deadline on the assigment. The given task itself should take around 3-4 hours anyway.
Please send your completed task back via your github repo.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me!

Bests,
[Sender]
